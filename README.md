# meow-bot

Date of creation: January 22, 2019 

Meow-Bot is a discord music bot that uses the Node.JS environment. It mainly plays music in discord voice channels 
but has other fun uses like linking memes and rolling rng ..etc as well. 

I did not write most of the code myself, and instead made extensive use of existing packages such as discord.js, discord.js-musicbot-addon, discord.js-commando.
